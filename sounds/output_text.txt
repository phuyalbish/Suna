 was

a woman

beautiful and strong

her eyes held the galaxies

and her hair was the night sky

she was the embodiment of a dream

a dream of love and hope

a dream of a better future

she was the light in the darkness

the hope in the despair

she was the one who could make a difference

she was the one who could bring change

she was the one who could make the world a better place

and she was the one who could make me believe in myself again
